# Note App With Compose
This is a simple Note App that I made using Jetpack Compose. This app is a simple app that can add, edit, and delete notes. This app also uses Room to store data.

# Overview
This app has 3 screens:
1. Home Screen: This screen displays a list of notes. You can add, edit, and delete notes here.
2. Add Note Screen: This screen is used to add a new note.
3. Edit Note Screen: This screen is used to edit a note.
